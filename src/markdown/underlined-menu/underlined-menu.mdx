# Underlined menu
## Great example of very basic AnimateSharedLayout usage.

import UnderlinedMenu from '../../components/underlined-menu/UnderlinedMenu';

<div className="guide__component-wrapper">
  <div className="underlined-menu__guide-wrapper">
    <UnderlinedMenu />
  </div>
</div>

Despite looking subtle and cool, this menu transition is really easy to do. To be honest, the only thing we animate manually is the underline opacity. `AnimateSharedLayout` component is responsible for all rest of the magic. So, let's start with `UnderlinedMenu` component. 

```jsx
const menuItems = ['Lorem', 'ipsum', 'dolor', 'sit'];

const UnderlinedMenu = () => {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="underlined-menu">
      <div className="wrapper">
        <AnimateSharedLayout>
          {menuItems.map((el, i) => (
            <MenuItem 
              text={el} 
              key={i}
              selected={selected === i}
              onClick={() => setSelected(i)}
            /> 
          ))}
        </AnimateSharedLayout>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

There's not much to explain, except the `AnimateSharedLayout` component. As you can see, all the logic outside the return statement is simple `useState` hook which keeps the information about which menu item is currently selected.

Let's focus on `AnimateSharedLayout`, which we can use to animate between completely different `motion` components. If there is a `motion` component inside `AnimateSharedLayout` with a `layoutId` and it gets removed as another component with the same `layoutId` is added, the new component will automatically perform a layout animation from previous one. At the bottom of the page I linked another great example of that, which I found in Framer's docs. 

```jsx
const MenuItem = ({ text, selected, onClick }) => (
    <motion.div 
        className="menu-item" 
        onClick={onClick} 
        animate={{ opacity: selected ? 1 : .5}}
    >
        {text}
        {selected && (
            <motion.div 
                className="underline" 
                layoutId="underline" 
            />
        )}
    </motion.div>
)
```

`MenuItem` isn't too complicated aswell. `text` prop is just the text that component displays, `selected` is a boolean value which tells the component whether it's selected or not, and `onClick` sets `MenuItem` as the selected one in `UnderlinedMenu` state.

As I mentioned, the only thing animated manually is the opacity. If `MenuItem` is selected, its non opaque, if not, its half opaque. 

The tricky thing is the second div with `underline` class. As you can see, it is only rendered if `MenuItem` is selected and it has layoutId. Only one `MenuItem` can be selected at the same time, so if you select one item, another's underline disappears, and because underlines have the same layoutId and are wrapped in `AnimateSharedLayout`, a layout animation is performed every time selected item changes. That's all!
