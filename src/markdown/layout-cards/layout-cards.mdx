# Layout cards
## A little bit trickier usage of layout animations.

<div className="guide__component-wrapper">
  <div className="layout-cards__guide-wrapper">
    <LayoutCards />
  </div>
</div>

Framer motion's layout animations are really powerful and I think this is a great example of that. Despite looking quite complex, this component is actually pretty simple, maybe except one trick. Anyway, let's dive into the code. 

```jsx
const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(null);

<div className="layout-cards">
  {cards.map((card, i) => (
    <motion.div 
      className={selectedId === card ? 'opened-card' : 'card' }
      key={i}
      layout
      drag={selectedId === card ? 'x' : false}
    >
      {selectedId === card && (
        <>
          <div />
          <div />
          <div />
        </>
      )}
    </motion.div>
  ))}
  <motion.div 
    className="dim-layer" 
    animate={{ opacity: selectedId ? .3 : 0 }}
  />
</div>
```

Main concept is really simple: there's a state storing information about which card is currently selected. Card's `className` vary, depending on whether the card is selected or not. `card` class is nothing more than just a white rectangle placed in a grid, but `opened-card` comes with more functionality. It works as a draggable container for opened 'gallery'. As you can see, horizontal drag is also only enabled when card is selected:

```jsx
drag={selectedId === card ? 'x' : false}
```

These 3 anonymous divs rendered if the card is selected are the 'children' gallery cards, displaying in the draggable container. 

```jsx
{selectedId === card && (
  <>
    <div />
    <div />
    <div />
  </>
)}
```

Dim layer is a full width and height layer between opened card's content and rest of the component, widh a black background color and pointer events disabled. Initially it's fully transparent, but when card is selected its opacity becomes 0.3. 

```jsx
<motion.div 
  className="dim-layer" 
  animate={{ opacity: selectedId ? .3 : 0 }}
/>
```

To this point everything was pretty simple. The tricky part (in my opinion) is to make card closing animation look good. Because whole draggable container is the layout-animated element, and its appearance differs in many ways from a simple, white rectangular closed card, the layout animation looks bad if its scrolled right. See that by yourself, changing `handlePanEnd` to:

```jsx
const handlePanEnd = (e, info, card) => {
  if (selectedId && info.offset.x < 5) {
    setSelectedId(null);
  } else {
    setSelectedId(card);
  }
}
```

To fix that, as you might have guessed if you tried the code from above, I made the container to scroll left firstly, before actually deselecting a card. For that, I set up a separate state value to track whether the container can be dragged or not:

```jsx
const [canDrag, setCanDrag] = useState(false);
```

It's being set to true each time a card is selected. As I mentioned, I need this value to scroll the container to the left when it's closing, and I achieved that this tricky way:

```jsx
dragConstraints={{ left: canDrag ? -850 : 0, right: 0 }}
```

`dragConstraints` from the code above is a prop passed to cards container. You can pass an object with optional values of `top, left, right` and `bottom` to define maximum drag distance in these directions, measured in pixels. So, `left: -850` means that user can drag 850 pixels 'to the left' from the left border.    

The tricky thing here is if we set `dragConstraints` to 0 when the container is scrolled, it will smoothly animate back to its default, non-dragged position.

Last thing left is to make the container close just after the 'scroll-back' animation finishes. For that, I calculated the timeout based on how far the container is scrolled. Normally, if the container were just a regular element with a `overflow: scroll`, I could get the information about scroll progress from its `ref.current.scrollLeft`, but it's a Framer Motion's draggable object instead. As the user drags, its `scrollLeft` remains 0 and its moved just by CSS `translate`. 

Anyway, first thing that needed to be done to access any information was creating the refs. As there are multiple cards, I created a ref array:

```jsx
const containerRefs = useRef(new Array());
```

And pushed the cards into it:

```jsx
{cards.map((card, i) => (
  <motion.div 
    ref={el => containerRefs.current[card] = el}
  >
  //rest of code
  </motion.div>
))}
```

With refs ready, let's take a look on `handlePanEnd` function.

```jsx
const handlePanEnd = (e, info, card) => {
  if (selectedId) {
    if (Math.abs(info.offset.x) < 5) {
      const styles = getComputedStyle(containerRefs.current[card]);
      const timeout = styles.transform.split(',')[4] * -.6;

      setCanDrag(false);
      setTimeout(() => {
        setSelectedId(null);
      }, timeout);
    }
  } else {
    setCanDrag(true);
    setSelectedId(card);
  }
}
```

This function is a callback for `onPanEnd`, which is basically the same as `onMouseUp`. If there isn't a card selected (`selectedId` is false), function only selects a card and updates states. More things are happening in cases when there's a card selected. Firstly, it checks if the event was actually a click and not a drag to make card not close at drag end. 

```jsx
if (Math.abs(info.offset.x) < 5) {
//rest of code
}
```

To do that, I check if the horizontal offset is less than 5, which means that user has dragged no more than 5px. If I set the condition to `offset === 0` instead, only direct clicks would pass it. `offset` is a property of `info` object, which Framer Motion passes to event callback functions and it contains various data about the event. 

Now, when I'm sure that user intended to close the card, it's time to calculate previously mentioned timeout. 

```jsx
const styles = getComputedStyle(containerRefs.current[card]);
const timeout = styles.transform.split(',')[4] * -.6;
```

Firstly I used `getComputedStyle` with card ref passed as argument to get an object containg the values of all CSS properties of a card element. Although there isn't a `transformX` property, I could get it just from `styles.transform` which is a string containing 3d matrix, looking like that: `matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, -200, 0)`. 5th value, in this example -200 is the `transformX` value we are looking for. To get it into a separate variable I splitted the string by comma, and picked 5th value from the result array. Then, I multiplied it by -0.6 to make it positive and a little bit smaller, to make it more similiar to actual animation time.

```jsx
setCanDrag(false);
setTimeout(() => {
  setSelectedId(null);
}, timeout);
```

Now, with an appropriate timeout calculated, I set `canDrag` to true to make the container go back to its default position, and after that `selectedId` to null, to deselect a card and make it animate back to a white rectangle again. That's all!
