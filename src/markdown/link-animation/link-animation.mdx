# Link hover animation
## Simple, yet cool effect. More of CSS trick, but still there's some Framer Motion magic.

<div className="guide__component-wrapper">
  <div className="link-animation__guide-wrapper">
    <LinkAnimation />
  </div>
</div>

This hover effect is actually more of CSS trick than Framer motion, so I will focus a little bit on explaining the CSS first.

Each letter consists of the container that wraps two divs: one for lowercase and one for uppercase letter. I used monospace font, so each container can have fixed width. Container's position is set to relative, so children (letters) can be positioned absolutely, and one of them is being moved from `left: -100%` to `left: 0` when container is hovered.

```jsx
const LinkAnimation = () => {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="link-animation">
      <div 
        className="container"
        onMouseOver={() => setIsHovered(true)}
        onMouseOut={() => setIsHovered(false)}  
      >
        {'hover'.split('').map((letter, i) => (
          <div className="letter-container" key={i}>
            <div>{letter}</div>
            <motion.div
              initial={{ left: '-100%' }}
              animate={{ left: isHovered ? '0%' : '-100%' }}
              transition={{ 
                duration: isHovered ? .7 : .5, 
                ease: [.7, 0, .3, 1]
              }}
            >
              {letter.toUpperCase()}
            </motion.div>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

JavaScript's side of this component is pretty simple. `isHovered` contains information whether component is hovered. If it is, capitalized letter is animated to be visible by setting `left: 0%`. 

One thing worth mentioning is this ease array in transition prop. Except built-in easings like `easeIn` and `easeOut`, you can create your own by specifying cubic Bezier curve points and passing them as an array. I linked really useful cubic bezier generator below.
