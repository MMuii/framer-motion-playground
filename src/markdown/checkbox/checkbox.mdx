# Checkbox
## You can animate SVGs easier than you'd think.

<div className="guide__component-wrapper">
  <div className="checkbox__guide-wrapper">
    <Checkbox />
  </div>
</div>

The two main tricks used in this project are CSS clip paths and SVG path length property. Let's start with the main concept:

```jsx
<div className="checkbox">
  <div className="checkbox-container checkbox-container--back">
    <svg 
      className="checkmark checkmark--back"
      viewBox="0 0 215 180" 
    >
      <path 
          d="M21 88.9819L40.3022 133.001C46.7847 147.784 67.1425 149.146 75.5651 135.376C107.35 83.4098 123.233 60.8675 200 27" 
          strokeDasharray="1 1"
      />
    </svg>

    <div className="lines-container">
      <div className="line line--1" />
      <div className="line line--2" />
      <div className="line line--3" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="checkbox-container checkbox-container--front">
    <svg 
      className="checkmark checkmark--front"
      viewBox="0 0 215 180" 
    >
      <path 
        d="M21 88.9819L40.3022 133.001C46.7847 147.784 67.1425 149.146 75.5651 135.376C107.35 83.4098 123.233 60.8675 200 27" 
        strokeDasharray="1 1"
      />
    </svg>
  </div>
</div>
```

Checkbox consists of two containers - back and front one. Both of them are placed in the same spot and have the same checkmark SVG images inside, except the front one has `overflow` set to `hidden`, and back one doesn't. First checkmark is filled white and it belongs to the front container, and second is placed in the back with fill of red color. To achieve that opposing color overflow effect I made SVGs a little larger than the containers, and because of the front container has `overflow: hidden` property, the overflowing part of the checkmark you can see is actually an end of the second, white filled SVG. 

Rest of the component is really simple, when the checkmark animation finishes, three lines animation starts and gives the user nice 'tick' feeling. The animation itself isn't complex aswell, the only animated property is lines' `clipPath`. 

```jsx
const variants = {
  checked: { 
    pathLength: 1, 
    transition: { duration: .3 } 
  },
  unchecked: { 
    pathLength: 0, 
    transition: { duration: .3 } 
  }
}

const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false);
const pathLength = useMotionValue(0);
const opacity = useTransform(pathLength, [.05, .15], [0, 1]);

<motion.svg 
  className="checkmark checkmark--back"
  viewBox="0 0 215 180" 
  animate={isChecked ? "checked" : "unchecked"}
>
  <motion.path 
    d="M21 88.9819L40.3022 133.001C46.7847 147.784 67.1425 149.146 75.5651 135.376C107.35 83.4098 123.233 60.8675 200 27" 
    variants={variants}
    style={{ pathLength, opacity }}
    strokeDasharray="1 1"
  />
</motion.svg>
```

Let's move on to the code, more specifically to the SVG animation. There are two variants passed to `path`, which are triggered by `svg` parent element in it's `animate` prop. If button is checked, SVG path length is animated to "checked" variant, otherwise to "unchecked". 

Path `opacity` is also animated, but in a slightly different way - it depends on current `pathLength`. By manually creating `pathLength MotionValue` and passing it to `style` prop, I can use it as an input for `useTransform` hook for calculating another value. 

```jsx
const opacity = useTransform(pathLength, [.05, .15], [0, 1]);
```

Basically, `useTransform` accepts three arguments: value, input range, output range and maps the input value from input range of values into output range. For example, if `pathLength` (input value) were .5, the return value would be 1. If input value were .1, return would be .5.

In this case returned opacity will be mostly 1, running down to 0 quickly when `pathLength` approach value of .15 and less. I passed calculated `opacity` to `path` style prop, so it animates in parallel with `pathLength`.

```jsx
<motion.div 
    className="checkbox"
    onClick={() => {
        !isChecked && lineAnimation();
        setIsChecked(!isChecked);
    }}
>
  
</motion.div>
```

The div above is the main container. Except toggling the `isChecked` state value, it triggers the `lineAnimation` if the button wasn't checked. Let's take a look on that function.

```jsx
const lineControls = useAnimation();

const lineAnimation = async () => {
  await lineControls.start({ 
    clipPath: 'polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%)',
    transition: { duration: .15, delay: .2 }
  });

  await lineControls.start({ 
    clipPath: 'polygon(100% 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 100% 100%)',
    transition: { duration: .15 }
  });

  lineControls.start({ 
    clipPath: 'polygon(0 0, 0 0, 0 100%, 0% 100%)', 
    transition: { duration: 0 } 
  });
}

<div className="lines-container">
  <motion.div 
    className="line line--1" 
    animate={lineControls} 
  />
  <motion.div 
    className="line line--2" 
    animate={lineControls} 
  />
  <motion.div 
    className="line line--3" 
    animate={lineControls} 
  />
</div>
```

Framer Motion allows us to run animations imperatively, which is really usefull for more complex orchestration. To do so, firstly we have to create animation controls using `useAnimation`. 

```jsx
const lineControls = useAnimation();
```

Such controls can be now passed to motion component as an animate prop. From now, you can manually trigger animations by `start()` whenever you want. You can specify your animation as an object and pass it to `start` function, or you can pass just a variant name, if your component has any. Both ways will work. 

```jsx
const lineAnimation = async () => {
  await lineControls.start({ 
    clipPath: 'polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%)',
    transition: { duration: .15, delay: .2 }
  });

  await lineControls.start({ 
    clipPath: 'polygon(100% 0, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 100% 100%)',
    transition: { duration: .15 }
  });

  lineControls.start({ 
    clipPath: 'polygon(0 0, 0 0, 0 100%, 0% 100%)', 
    transition: { duration: 0 } 
  });
}
```

`onClick` of main container triggers the function above which controls the lines animation. As you can see, it's a `async` function, and there's a good reason for that.
`start` returns a promise, so you can sequence animations using `await`. In the code above, each `start` will firstly wait for previous to complete, before actually starting. In this case it's super useful and really simple: first `start` animate lines to be visible, then second one hides them. Third one is for resetting the `clipPath` instantly (`duration: 0`) to initial value, so animation can be performed once again.
