# Infinite cards
## Swipe as many times as you want!

<div className="guide__component-wrapper">
  <div className="infinite-cards__guide-wrapper">
    <InfiniteCards />
  </div>
</div>

Let's start recreating the component above by setting up initial states and importing necessary things. I also created `colors` array with colors from which we will draw random colors for the cards.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useContext } from 'react';
import { 
  motion, 
  useMotionValue, 
  useTransform, 
  useMotionTemplate 
} from 'framer-motion';

const colors = [
  '#FFBE0B', 
  '#FB5607', 
  '#FF006E', 
  '#8338EC', 
  '#3A86FF'
];

const InfiniteCards = () => {
  const [cards, setCards] = useState([
    { text: 'Up or down', background: colors[0] }, 
    { text: 'Left or right', background: colors[1] }, 
    { text: 'Swipe me!', background: colors[2] }
  ]);

  const [dragStart, setDragStart] = useState({
    axis: null,
    animation: { x: 0, y: 0 }
  });

  return (
    <div className="infinite-cards">
      {renderCards()}
    </div>
  )
}
```

First `useState` hook will be used to contain currently active cards, their background colors and displayed text. Later, we will map over `cards` object to render the content. As you can see, there will be always 3 active cards at the same time.

Second state `dragStart` contains data about drag and corresponding card animation. When user starts the gesture, data will be stored here.

```jsx
const renderCards = () => {
  return cards.map((card, index) => {
    if (index === cards.length - 1) {
      return (
        <Card 
          card={card}
          key={index}
          style={{ x, y, zIndex: index }}
          onDirectionLock={axis => onDirectionLock(axis)}
          onDragEnd={(e, info) => onDragEnd(info)}
          animate={dragStart.animation}
        />
      )
    } else return (
      <Card 
        card={card}
        key={index}
        style={{
          scale, 
          boxShadow,
          zIndex: index
        }}
      />
    )
  })
}
```

`renderCards` maps over `cards` and returns `Card` component, which I will cover in next code block. When `map` function finds last card, it passes to it drag handling functions. It won't do so to previous cards, because only last one needs to handle events, as the only visible. 

```jsx
const Card = ({ card, style, onDirectionLock, onDragEnd, animate }) => (    
  <motion.div
    className="card"
    drag
    dragConstraints={{ left: 0, right: 0, top: 0, bottom: 0 }}
    dragDirectionLock
    onDirectionLock={onDirectionLock}
    onDragEnd={onDragEnd}
    animate={animate}
    style={{ ...style, background: card.background }}
    transition={{ ease: [.6, .05, -.01, .9] }}
    whileTap={{ scale: .85 }}
  >
    <p>{card.text}</p>
  </motion.div>
)
```

`Card` component isn't too complex aswell. It doesn't contain any logic, but let's analyse the props, especially drag-related ones. 

- `drag`, when set to true, enables dragging.
- `dragConstraints` defines (in pixels) how far the draggable component can be actually dragged. When dragged over the constraints, it will jump back to the last viable position. It might seem different at the first glance, but we don't want our card to be able to be dragged anywhere, so I set all the constraints to 0. Check it by yourself - if you drag the card too close away, nothing will happen. Only if you drag far enough, card will slide away.
- `onDirectionLock` is a callback function that runs when drag direction is determined. If you drag vertically it will return "y", if horizontally, "x".
- `onDragEnd` speak for itself. As you probably guessed, it's a callback function that fire when drag event starts or ends.
- `animate` describes card animation. Whenever this prop changes, framer motion will animate the component to new values. `transition` describes... well, the animation's transition. If not set manually, framer motion will create default one.
- `style` is just React inline css styling.
- `whileTap` - when tapped or clicked, component will animate to passed values.

```jsx
const x = useMotionValue(0);
const y = useMotionValue(0);
const scale = useTransform(dragStart.axis === 'x' ? x : y, [-175, 0, 175], [1, .5, 1]);
const shadowBlur = useTransform(dragStart.axis === 'x' ? x : y, [-175, 0, 175], [0, 25, 0]);
const shadowOpacity = useTransform(dragStart.axis === 'x' ? x : y, [-175, 0, 175], [0, .2, 0]);
const boxShadow = useMotionTemplate`0 ${shadowBlur}px 25px -5px rgba(0, 0, 0, ${shadowOpacity})`;
```

Let's take a look on these `useMotionValues` and `useTransforms`. Basically, `useTransform` hook is used to calculate some animation value based on another value. Before diving into these hooks, you need to understand what `MotionValue` is. Docs say: "MotionValues track the state and velocity of animating values". And indeed, `MotionValue` is just a string or number that Framer Motion uses to track the state of animation. Usually it is created automatically, but we create it manually to pass it to `useTransform`. As you might guessed, `MotionValue` is created by `useMotionValue`. Zeroes passed as arguments are the initial values.

`useTransform` accepts three arguments: input value, input range and output range. 

```jsx
const scale = useTransform(dragStart.axis === 'x' ? x : y, [-175, 0, 175], [1, .5, 1]);
```

In the example above, we pass `x` or `y`, depending on the drag axis, as input. Then, `useTransform` checks its value and maps it to the output range accordingly to the input range. So, for example, if input was -100, `useTransform` would return adequate value from range between 1 and 0.5. 

That's the way we calculate animation properties based on another property. When user drags a card, its `x` or `y` changes, and the farther the drag goes, the larger the previous card's scale is, and the subtler the shadow gets.

Last thing I didn't mention is `useMotionTemplate` hook, but it's actually pretty simple. As the docs say, `useMotionTemplate` combines multiple motion values into a new one using a string template literal. And we did exactly that to get whole box shadow dynamically updated with previously calculated `shadowBlur` and `shadowOpacity`.

```jsx
const onDirectionLock = axis => setDragStart({ ...dragStart, axis: axis });

const animateCardSwipe = animation => {
  setDragStart({ ...dragStart, animation });
    
  setTimeout(() => {
    setDragStart({ axis: null, animation: { x: 0, y: 0 } });
    x.set(0);
    y.set(0);
    setCards([{ 
        text: 'just an another card', 
        background: randomColor(cards[0].background) 
      }, ...cards.slice(0, cards.length - 1)]);
  }, 200);
}

const onDragEnd = info => {
  if (dragStart.axis === 'x') {
    if (info.offset.x >= 100) 
      animateCardSwipe({ x: 175, y: 0 });
    else if (info.offset.x <= -100)
      animateCardSwipe({ x: -175, y: 0 }); 
  } else {
    if (info.offset.y >= 100)
      animateCardSwipe({ x: 0, y: 175 }); 
    else if (info.offset.y <= -100)
      animateCardSwipe({ x: 0, y: -175 }); 
  }
}
```

Now, let's take a look on the event handlers. `onDirectionLock` fires once the drag axis is determined and updates the state with fresh data. When user finishes the drag, `onDragEnd` checks the drag's offset, which is passed in `info` object as argument. If user has dragged the card farther than 100 pixels in some direction, `animateCardSwipe` is called with object that describes in which direction card should be animated.

`animateCardSwipe` firstly updates state with data received from `onDragEnd`, and by doing that it makes `Card` animate, as it gets new values passed as `animate` prop. Take a look again at `renderCards` and `Card` component and I am sure now everyting will be clear about how it works. Then, setTimeout is being run with timeout of 200 miliseconds - about the same time `Card` animation takes, so we make sure the code will be executed after the animation finishes. First three lines inside setTimeout sets the state and MotionValues to the initial values. Then, new card is pushed to the array, and last one, which has been just dragged away, is removed. 

```jsx
const randomColor = current => {
  while (true) {
    const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length);
    if (current != colors[index]) {
      return colors[index];
    } 
  }
}
```

Very last think I haven't mentioned yet is `randomColor` function. All it does is return a random color, different from `current` passed as argument. That's why we called it with `cards[0].background` in `animateCardSwipe`.

And that's all! Below, I put links to usefull Framer Motion docs. If you have any questions, feel free to ask about anything in the comments.
