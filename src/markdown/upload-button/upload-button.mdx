# Upload button
## The power of AnimationControls!

<div className="guide__component-wrapper">
  <div className="upload-button__guide-wrapper">
    <UploadButton />
  </div>
</div>

In this component one single, asynchronous function is responsible for pretty much all of the animations. Let's start with the main concept.

```jsx
return (
  <div className="upload-button">
    <div className="wrapper" onClick={() => !isAnimating && animate()}>
      <motion.div 
        className="container upload"
        animate={uploadControls}
        whileHover="hovered"
      >
        <motion.i className="fas fa-angle-double-up" variants={iconVariants}/>
        <div>upload</div>
      </motion.div>

      <motion.div 
        className="container loading"
        animate={loadingControls}
      >
        <motion.div className="loader" animate={loaderControls} />
        <div>loading</div>
        <motion.div className="loading-bar" animate={loadingBarControls}/>
      </motion.div>
      
      <motion.div  
        className="container done"
        animate={doneControls}
      >
        <i className="fas fa-check" />
        <div>done</div>
      </motion.div>
    </div>
  </div>
)
```

`wrapper` contains 3 sibling divs, which are containers for each 'layer' of the button. Animation mechanism basically on animating containers' `zIndex` and `top` values in the correct order. 

```jsx
const uploadControls = useAnimation();
const loadingControls = useAnimation();
const doneControls = useAnimation();
const loaderControls = useAnimation();
const loadingBarControls = useAnimation();
```

As I mentioned, one single asynchronous function does pretty much all the animations here. But, to make it work that way, animations must be controlled by `AnimationControls`, created with `useAnimation` hook.

With `AnimationControls` you can trigger or stop animations programmaticaly with `start` and `stop` methods. Also, `start` returns a promise so you can sequence animations using `await`, or `then`. I used `async await` variant here. One more thing that needs to be done to use `start` method is passing `AnimationControls` as `animate` prop to `motion` component. I did so to every container, as you can see in the first code fragment.

Moving on to `animate` function, I think the best way to explain what is going inside of it is just to paste the code with appropriate comments:

```jsx
const animate = async () => {
  //setting the state value to true
  setIsAnimating(true);

  //there are 3 layers: 'upload', 'loading' and 'done'
  //they are visible in the same order

  //resetting uploadControls zIndex to 1
  //at the end of the function it is set to 4
  //so it needs to be resetted to 1 again
  uploadControls.start({
    zIndex: 1
  });

  //triggering loading layer slide-down animation
  //its z-index is set to 2 in CSS
  await loadingControls.start({
    top: 0,
    transition: { duration: .3 }
  });

  //animating loading bar from width 0% to 100%
  //simulating the progress
  loadingBarControls.start({
    width: '100%',
    transition: { duration: 1.35 }
  });

  //putting upload layer above the button so it can slide down again
  //after the uploading is 'finished'
  //duration: 0 means it is done immediately
  uploadControls.start({
    top: '-100%',
    transition: { duration: 0 }
  });

  //triggering done layer slide-down animation
  //its z-index is set to 3 in CSS
  //delay: 1.5 so it waits for progress bar to finish its animation
  await doneControls.start({ 
    top: 0,
    transition: { delay: 1.5, duration: .3 }
  });

  //putting loading layer above the button so it can 
  //be animated again
  loadingControls.start({
    top: '-100%',
    transition: { duration: 0 }
  });

  //resetting loading bar width to 0
  loadingBarControls.start({
    width: '0%'
  });

  //setting upload layer to 4 to make it 
  //on the front again
  await uploadControls.start({ 
    top: 0,
    zIndex: 4,
    transition: { delay: 2, duration: .3 }
  });

  //putting done layer above the button so it can
  //be animated again
  doneControls.start({
    top: '-100%',
    transition: { duration: 0 }
  });

  //setting the state to false to communicate that
  //animation has finished
  setIsAnimating(false);
};
```

One thing I haven't mention yet is `isAnimating` state variable. I use it to prevent user from triggering animation again, before it finished. I set it to `true` when the animation begins and to `false`, then it ends. 

```jsx
//button's wrapper container onClick
//it won't call animate() if isAnimating is true
onClick={() => !isAnimating && animate()}
```

And the very last thing is that really subtle upload layer hover animation. If you hover it, double chevron icon inside go 2px up and down. 

```jsx
const iconVariants = {
  hovered: {
    y: [0, -2, 0, 2, 0],
    transition: { duration: .5, ease: 'easeInOut' }
  }
}
```

To animate icon on its parent hover event, I had to use variants. 

```jsx
//parent whileHover
whileHover="hovered"

//child with "hovered" variant
<motion.i className="fas fa-angle-double-up" variants={iconVariants}/>
```

By setting parent `whileHover` to a variant name, it will propagate through children and if some of them have variant with the same name, it will be animated aswell.
